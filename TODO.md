* Things that need to be completed before the game is finished:
	- 3 campaigns:
		- A very basic one, to indroduce a player to the game
		- One with "normal" tracks
		- And one with the very challenging tracks like Eternity Gate
	- Local multiplayer
		- Just need to add ending leaderboard and replay options
	- Online Multiplayer
	- *Also*: Better campaign system:
		- When press "play", it shows icons for the three campaigns.
		- When you select a track it asks you if you want to play is singleplayer,
		online or local.
** Minor things:
	- Tidy up code
	- Add comments (hashtags) to explain code
